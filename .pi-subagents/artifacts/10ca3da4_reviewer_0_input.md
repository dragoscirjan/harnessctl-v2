# Task for reviewer

Read-only Verify review for Epic hrn-00157 in /home/dragosc/Workspace/gh--harnessctl/harnessctl-v2. Do not edit. Review current uncommitted diff excluding unrelated .gitignore for correctness, maintainability, security/privacy, compatibility, docs/ops, and acceptance fit. Focus on configurable MCP-first web retrieval with fixed server id sdlc_web_crawl, default disabled, enabled MCP projection to @dragoscirjan/mcp-searchable. Return pass/fail with concise findings and evidence.

Required evidence: changed-files, tests-added, commands-run, validation-output, residual-risks, no-staged-files

Review gate: required by reviewer.
